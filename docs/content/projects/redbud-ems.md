## Overview
Redbud is a high-concurrency workforce platform designed to bridge the gap between complex contract requirements and employee skill sets. Built with a Django REST backend and a reactive React frontend, it handles real-time resource allocation for large-scale operations.

### Key Achievements
* **Gemini-Powered Agents**: Developed custom agents using Google's Gemini API to analyze contract metadata and automatically propose optimal employee-to-project assignments based on historical performance and current availability.
* **Vectorized Skill Matching**: Implemented a RAG pipeline that transforms employee resumes and project descriptions into high-dimensional vector embeddings. This allows for semantic matching that goes beyond simple keyword searches, identifying lateral skills that might otherwise be missed.
* **Automated Skill-Gap Analysis**: The system proactively identifies missing competencies across 500+ active contracts, generating automated training recommendations to ensure workforce readiness.
* **Operational Impact**: By automating attendance insights and reporting through GenAI summarization, the platform reduced manual administrative overhead by approximately 60%.
