## Technical Deep Dive
This project showcases low-level implementations of foundational AI models.

### Implementations
* **Transformers from Scratch**: Built a complete Transformer model trained on Tiny Shakespeare, including positional embeddings and multi-head attention mechanisms.
* **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: Developed a GAN architecture on the CIFAR-10 dataset for image synthesis, training both generator and discriminator with adversarial objectives.
