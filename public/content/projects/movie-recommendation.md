## Recommendation Engine
A sophisticated hybrid system designed to solve the "cold start" problem and provide highly personalized content discovery. It blends traditional statistical methods with modern deep learning.

### Hybrid Approach
* **Collaborative Filtering**: Analyzes user behavior patterns to find similarities between users and items.
* **Content-Based Filtering**: Leverages movie metadata (genres, directors, cast) to recommend similar content.
* **Neural Network Model**: Implemented a deep learning layer that learns complex, non-linear interactions between users and movies, significantly improving prediction accuracy.
* **Evaluation & Metrics**: The system was rigorously tested using metrics like RMSE and MAE to ensure that recommendations remain both accurate and diverse, capturing the nuance of individual user tastes.
