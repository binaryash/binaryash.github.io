I am a multi-disciplinary engineer specializing in building end-to-end solutions from architecture to deployment. My expertise spans **Full-Stack development**, **AI/ML**, **GenAI**, and **Embedded Systems**.

I handle the entire lifecycle—including development, testing, and DevOps—ensuring robust delivery for both software and intelligent applications from architecture to maintenance.
