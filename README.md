# Minimalist Portfolio | Binary Ash

A high-performance, monochromatic portfolio designed for a multi-disciplinary engineer specializing in **Full-Stack Development**, **AI/ML**, and **Embedded Systems**. This project focuses on minimalism, typography, and a seamless developer experience by separating metadata from long-form content using Markdown.

## 🚀 Overview

This portfolio is built with a modern frontend stack and features a modular content system. It architecturally separates the site structure from the actual content, allowing for easy updates without modifying the source code.

- **Live Site**: [binaryash.github.io](https://binaryash.github.io)
- **Tech Stack**: React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Content Management**: External Markdown files for Bio, Projects, and Blog Posts

## ✨ Key Features

- **Monochromatic Aesthetic**: A clean, "blended" design with a soft monochromatic palette and smooth transitions.
- **Dynamic Content Loading**: Content is fetched dynamically from `.md` files, keeping the main application lightweight.
- **Responsive Layout**: Optimized for all devices, from high-resolution desktops to mobile screens.
- **Dark Mode Support**: Built-in theme toggling with system preference detection.
- **Automated Deployment**: Fully configured GitHub Actions pipeline for seamless deployment to GitHub Pages.
- **Recruiter Optimized**: Ergonomic header-placed Resume button and clear technical project summaries.

## 📝 Content Management

The site is designed to be "Content-Separated." To update your portfolio:

1.  **Metadata**: Update `config.ts` to add new projects, blog posts, or modify your skills list.
2.  **Long-form Content**: Add or edit `.md` files in `public/content/projects/` or `public/content/blog/`. The application will automatically fetch and render these files based on the paths provided in `config.ts`.

## 🛠️ Development
